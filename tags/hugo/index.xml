Though I found the generated pages to be a bit &amp;ldquo;packed&amp;rdquo;.
To be honest, the only parts required to be changed in the end were parts of the stylesheets but then, I would have skipped an opportunity to learn something new.
What do I want to achieve?</description></item><item><title>Personal GitHub Pages using Hugo</title><link>https://bvfnbk.github.io/posts/hugo/personal-page/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Jul 2022 10:33:40 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://bvfnbk.github.io/posts/hugo/personal-page/</guid><description>I used to play around with my personal GitHub page every once in a while. I used to set up the repository and initialized it using the recommended Jekyll way. Jekyll is a site generator implemented in Ruby - which is already there on my MacBook (severely outdated) or a brew install away (which might be an over-simplification).
It is equally easy to install Jekyll for local development. This alone would be great if not for the software upgrades coming in from time to time.</description></item></channel></rss>
